# FIRE ALARM USING ATMEGA328 MICROCONTROLLER

# Introduction
* Nowadays, fire incidents have become a critical issue , which must be dealt with on time without any unnecessary delay to avoid the loss in lives and belongings . It is considered a fire situation when the monitored temperature exceeds 50o C. In critical places such as hospitals, schools, and banks, personnel's arrival time to come for help in fire hazards is around 15 minutes .

# Objective of Project
The 4 Purposes of Your Fire Alarm System
The four ways your fire alarm system works to protect your property and its occupants from the dangers of fire are by detecting fire, alerting occupants, managing risk, and notifying the fire department.

#  Detect Fire
Your fire alarm system is designed to detect fire in two main ways: smoke and heat. It should also have the capability of manual pull, in case a fire is observed before smoke or heat reaches the sensors of the system. Other systems are activated when movement in the sprinkler system is detected, indicating that the sprinklers are responding to a fire. 

#  Alert Occupants
When the fire alarm system detects smoke, heat, or water movement, it alerts occupants of the building using both audible and visible alarms. These alarms will be bright, loud, obnoxious, and impossible to ignore, which help mobilize individuals to follow your evacuation plan. Using both types of alarms ensure that every person in the building is alerted.

# Manage Risks
Your buildingâ€™s fire alarm system works in a third way to protect you: by reacting to potential risks using control measures. When the alarm is activated, some systems perform a set of tasks that help prevent fire and smoke from spreading as well as protect occupants, such as: automatically shutting doors in different zones, powering off ventilation and air conditioning, or redirecting elevators to bring cars to a designated level.

# Notify Authorities
The fourth purpose of your fire alarm system is to notify authorities. This ensures the fire department is en route as quickly as possible, so they can respond and extinguish the fire before it becomes an even bigger threat. 

# An Embedded system
# Definition
 Embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software where software is usually known as firmware that is embedded into the hardware. Hardware of the embedded system is assembled with a microprocessor/microcontroller. It has the elements such as input/output interfaces, memory, user interface and the display unit.

# Components Used
* Micro controller ATMega 328
* Temperature sensor(which is used to check the temperature)
   But instead of the temperature sensor which is not available in the simullIde We are using the Potentiometer.
   Which Acts as a thermistor, Resists the flow of signal at low temperature and allows the flow at the particular and higher than that temperature.
* Buzzer(for cautioning the people)
* Smoke or fire sensor (which is used to detect Smoke or Fire)
* Led (Used as an indicator when the fire or smoke broke out)ss

# Conclusion
The fire detection systems proposed in the literature served fire stopping with no care of the responsiveness. Thus, this study considers the existing issues and build an efficient and effective fire detection system based on IoT technology, gas, temperature, and smoke sensors to collect the data accurately and rapidly
And alert all and help them from escape.
